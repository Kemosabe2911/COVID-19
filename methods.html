                <p>To protect yourself and others from coronavirus (COVID-19) itâ€™s important to think about how the virus is spread.

This can be direct or indirect (on hands, objects, surfaces). Keep this in mind. It will help you remember all the things you need to do to protect yourself and others from the virus.</p>
                <p>Social distancing is important to help slow the spread of coronavirus. It does this by minimising contact between potentially infected individuals and healthy individuals.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>keep a space of 2 metres (6.5 feet) between you and other people</li>
                    <li>reduce interactions with people outside the workplace and home</li>
                    <li>reduce the number of people you meet every day</li>
