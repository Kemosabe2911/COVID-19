                <h2>1.Avoid close Contact</h2>
                <img id="img1"src="images/img2.jpg" no-repeat>
                <p>To protect yourself and others from coronavirus (COVID-19) itâ€™s important to think about how the virus is spread.

                    Coronavirus is spread in sneeze or cough droplets. To infect you, it has to get from an infected person's nose or mouth into your eyes, nose or mouth. This can be direct or indirect (on hands, objects, surfaces). Keep this in mind. It will help you remember all the things you need to do to protect yourself and others from the virus.</p>
                <p>Social distancing is important to help slow the spread of coronavirus. It does this by minimising contact between potentially infected individuals and healthy individuals.</p>
                <p>Some of the things you can do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>keep a space of 2 metres (6.5 feet) between you and other people</li>
                    <li>reduce interactions with people outside the workplace and home</li>
                    <li>reduce the number of people you meet every day</li>
                    <li>avoid communal sleeping areas</li>
                    <li>avoid communal sleeping areas</li>
                    <li>work from home if possible</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2.Wash your hands properly and often</h2>
                <img id="img2" src="images/img3.jpg" no-repeat>
                <p>Keep your hands in good condition, moisturise them often. Any basic product that is not perfumed or coloured is OK. </p>
                <p>Do not wear gloves instead of washing your hands. The virus gets on them in the same way it gets on your hands. Also, your hands can get contaminated when you take them off.</p>
                <p>You should wash your hands:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After coughing or sneezing</li>
                    <li>Before and after eating</li>
                    <li>Before and after preparing food</li>
                    <li>If you were in contact with someone who has a fever or respiratory symptoms</li>
                    <li>Before and after being on public transport or in a crowd </li>
                    <li>If you have handled animals or animal waste</li>
                    <li>If your hands are dirty</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3.Use Face Masks</h2>
                <img id="img3" src="images/img6.jpg" no-repeat>
                <p>Using masks is unlikely to be of any benefit if you are not sick.</p>
                <p>Sick people will be advised by their doctor when to use a mask. Healthcare workers need masks and other personal protective equipment to protect them from infection during their work.</p>
